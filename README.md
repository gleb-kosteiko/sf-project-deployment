###How to deploy an existing Salesforce project to a new sandbox
Since separate parts of the SF project depend on each other, deploying it to a new sandbox could be trick. However, there is a straightforward deployment flow you can follow to prevent any potential issues. Salesforce is a growing platform (hence new features are coming), so this list might be incomplete.

To avoid the possible dependency errors, deploy the project components in the following order:

1. static resources
2. labels
3. groups
4. roles
5. letterhead
6. documents
7. OBJECTS
8. tabs
9. apps
10. roles
11. queues
12. groups
13. remote site settings
14. emails
15. classes
16. components
17. pages
18. weblinks
19. layouts
20. triggers
21. workflows
22. approval processes 
23. assignment rules
24. report types
25. reports
26. dashbords
27. homepage layouts
28. homepage components
29. flows
30. profiles
31. permission sets
